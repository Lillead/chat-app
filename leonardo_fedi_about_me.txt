Name: Leonardo Fedi

Study path: Interactive Media

Previous experiences with web development: very little, just the Introduction to programming course in Autumn 2022 and currently the Web and App minor.

What I would like to do when I grow up: unfortunately I am a grown-up already, this is my second degree.
In the future I would love to work in the video game industry, possibly as a game designer. I would like to work on RPG games, which are my favourites.

Anything else I feel like sharing: thank you for the course. The slides are clear and easy to follow.
